Eat until you’re full, and then go for dessert.
Sing until you lose your voice.
Dance until the DJ cuts the record and tells you to go home.
Laugh until you cry, and then cry until you’ve run out of tears, and then hydrate!
Juice the sun, and savor every last drop of light.

That’s what we call, total abandonment of emotional restraint.
